Gauntlet but better.

The server
----------

Prerequisites

    npm install socket.io
    npm install coffee-script

To run the server:

    coffee server/server.coffee


The client
----------

To compile the client first install guard

    gem install guard
    gem install guard-coffeescript

Then run `guard` to compile the coffeescript

To run a simple server you can use `alias serve="python -m SimpleHTTPServer"` and then `serve` from the client directory

Todo
----
**** Figure out why connections from other computers don't seem to work (when you change null to a hostname in the client's Socket.IO connection attempt)
* When a player connects notify other players so they can spawn a new player
* A client needs to be able to receive a "player move" event for other players
